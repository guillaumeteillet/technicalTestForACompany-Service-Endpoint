# Service Endpoint : Technical Test for Checkout.com

### Test

Create an endpoint which will be accessible through a friendly route. (This can be hosted on your localhost at least for now). 
     
The endpoint will work based on the following web requests:
+ Http Post request should adding a drink in to the list with quantity e.g. name of drink (Pepsi) and quantity (1)
+ Http Put request for updating a drinks quantity
+ Http Delete request for removing a drink from the shopping list
+ Http Get request for retrieving a drink by its name and its quantity so we can see how many ordered
+ Http Get request for retrieving full list of what we have in the shopping list

Notes:
+ This doesnâ€™t have to use database you can use in memory solution to hold the shopping list. Any thing simple that works
+ Ideally it should contain one unique drink name for each entry to avoid repetitions
+ Please feel free to implement/explain any advanced features to demonstrate your skills and experience such as paginated lists api authorisation and validation etc.
